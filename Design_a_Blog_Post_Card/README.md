# Design a Blog Post Card

Short description
-----------------
This small project demonstrates how to design a blog post card using HTML and CSS. The goal is to provide a clean, reusable card component with simple interactions (hover effects, image alignment).

Screenshots
-----------
Below is a screenshot of the blog post card as rendered in the demo. The image is included in the `screenshots/` folder.

Caption: Centered blog post card with image, title, description and a "Read More" button.


How to run (Windows PowerShell)
------------------------------
No additional setup is required. Open `index.html` in your browser. From PowerShell you can run:

```powershell
# Open the index.html file in your default browser from the current directory
Start-Process -FilePath .\index.html
```

Or simply double-click the `index.html` file in File Explorer.

Customization
-------------
- Edit `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, spacing, or layout.
- To reuse the card on other pages, copy the card HTML block from `index.html` and keep the related class/id attributes.

Development notes and limitations
--------------------------------
- This is a visual example only and does not include JavaScript.
- If you want more advanced responsive behavior or animations, add `@media` queries and CSS transitions/animations.


Thanks
